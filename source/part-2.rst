Some places require a bartending license, which are given out by schools after taking classes on bartending. Not all places have the same rules, and can vary on things like:

* Measuring.
    Some places allow for free pouring, which you eyeball how much liquor goes into the drink, while other places require you use a measuring tool like a |Jigger-Image|.
* Checking for IDs
    Depending on the establishment you may have varying rules on who to ID before serving. 
* House drinks vs common drinks
    Some drinks like a Long Island Ice Tea can vary depending on the establishment, while the core of the drink remains the same (gin, vodka, tequila, rum), they can change on other ingredients like triple sec, sweet and sour juice, and what kind of soda to use.
* Different types of places
    Working at a restaurant can be very different than working at a club or dive bar. Restaurants can be more oriented towards speed over interactions with the guest, while a traditional bar can have more time to converse and chat with the guest.
